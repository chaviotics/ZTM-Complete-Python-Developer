while condition:

else: # else will be executed when there is no break
    print("Hi")

# the idea here is that put something that can end the while loop
# to prevent infinite loop

# j = 0
# while j < 50:
#     print 


# while True:

#     input("Imo Mama:")

#     break

# Must make the condition false, or break it
