#1 - Import the data (THE HARDEST!!!)
#2 - Clean the data
#3 - Split the data into a (a)Training Set/(b)Test Set -> 80-20
#4 - Create a Model -> Import an algorithm 
#5 - Check the output of the model with the Test Set
#6 - Improve

# You need LOTS of data for Machine Learning to be efficient

# We use numpy, pandas, scikit learn, matplotlib, jupyter notebooks & Kaggle
